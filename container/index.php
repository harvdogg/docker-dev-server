<h1>Welcome to DevServer</h1>
<p>This is the default webpage of the server. This is meant to be replaced my mounting your local project development directory to /var/app in the Docker Container.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, the server is expecting to find it's "public" directory in order to server files out of it. Make sure your development directory includes this path.</p>
